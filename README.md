## R folder content

* 0: processing of some base layers used in the analysis

* 1: development of the dataset used for the analysis: compilation of GSIM data, species richness and the other variables employed in the analysis (sampling to the catchments when necessary)

* 2: adjustment and polishing of the dataset (note that many parts here are deprecated due to latest changes to the analysis)

* 3: modelling with LMER, interaction plots, spatial autocorrelation and other model diagnostics

* additional_figures: additional figures for the paper
